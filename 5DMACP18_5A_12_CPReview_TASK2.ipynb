To conclude this paper Coronavirus Pandemic recognized as Black Swan event according to considered figures and facts from recent references . IntroductionThere is a worldwide concern about the new coronavirus 2019 - nCoV as a global public health threat . The 2019 - nCoV infection is spreading and its incidence is increasing worldwide . Although the current mortality is lower than that of the SARS - CoV and the MERS - CoV , it seems that the 2019 - nCoV is very contagious . SARSCoV ( severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ) was recognized in November 2002 , MERS - CoV ( Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ) in June 2012 , and 2019 - nCoV in December 2019 . The first deaths occurred mostly in elderly people , among whom the disease might progress faster . But now it established that the young people are also prone to severe coronavirus disease so the society should still be cautious in dealing with the virus and pay more attention to protecting all of people from the virus . IntroductionCoronavirus spread worldwide with the pandemic according to data of World Health Organization ( WHO ) .

Using the recently published crystal structure of the SARS - CoV - 2 spike protein complexed with the human host cell receptor ACE2 , we characterized the structure and evolution of ACE2 in several of these species and identify a single interacting amino acid residue conserved between human and Felidae ACE2 but not in Canidae that correlates with virus susceptibility . Using computational analyses we describe how this site likely affects ACE2 targeting by the virus . Thus , we highlight how evolution - based approaches can be used to form hypotheses and study animal transmission of such viruses in the future . Lay summary : Recently , the virus that causes COVID - 19 was shown to transmit to companion animals . A single genetic change in the host receptor for the virus inherited in cats , but not dogs , correlates with feline susceptibility . With human - to - cat transmission of COVID - 19 confirmed , such information can inform public health policy regarding companion animals .

Using the recently published crystal structure of the SARS - CoV - 2 spike protein complexed with the human host cell receptor ACE2 , we characterized the structure and evolution of ACE2 in several of these species and identify a single interacting amino acid residue conserved between human and Felidae ACE2 but not in Canidae that correlates with virus susceptibility . Using computational analyses we describe how this site likely affects ACE2 targeting by the virus . Thus , we highlight how evolution - based approaches can be used to form hypotheses and study animal transmission of such viruses in the future . Lay summary : Recently , the virus that causes COVID - 19 was shown to transmit to companion animals . A single genetic change in the host receptor for the virus inherited in cats , but not dogs , correlates with feline susceptibility . With human - to - cat transmission of COVID - 19 confirmed , such information can inform public health policy regarding companion animals .

The point - of - care format uses LoopX ( C ) , a small portative device ensuring optimal LAMP reaction and automated reading with 95 . 2 % and 95 . 5 % sensitivity and specificity respectively . This system might also be useful for testing other sample types such as saliva . RT - LAMP ( Reverse - Transcription and Loop - mediated isothermal AMPlification ) might advantageously increase testing efficiency as it allows all - in - one rapid test including RNA reverse transcription and DNA amplification without temperature cycles requirement . LAMP does not even require complex devices and laboratory infrastructures , RT - LAMP can use low - cost and mobile equipment already available in most molecular diagnostic laboratories and utilises the inhibitors tolerant Bst polymerase . These traits make LAMP useful in field detection assays . The use of LAMP in detection system has been explored for numerous micro - organisms and epidemic pathogen ( Zika - virus , Ebolavirus , Malaria ) several of which validated by WHO , an FAO [ 2 , 9 ] . SARS - CoV2 RT - LAMP tests were previously developed but to our knowledge , none of them propose a direct - from - swab , on field and all - in - one analytical solution such as ours . The innovationWe developed a specific RT - LAMP in dual format for the detection of SARS - CoV - 2 . The first one , named LoopXlab COVID - 19 operates without extraction in conventional thermalcyclers ( using 96 wells plates or 8 wells strips ) . The second one , named LoopXplore COVID - 19 , is designed for Point of Care ( without extraction ) and runs in the LoopX device ( in 1 . 5 ml µtube ) .

We can conclude that : rapid diagnostic tests for COVID - 19 are necessary , but should be adequately sensitive and specific ; few studies have been carried out to date ; the studies included are characterized by low numbers and low sample power , and in light of these results , the use of available tests is currently questionable for clinical purposes and cannot substitute other more reliable molecular tests , such as assays based on RT - PCR .

The analyses showed that tests using the S antigen are more sensitive than N antigen - based tests . IgG tests perform better compared to IgM ones , and show better sensitivity when the samples were taken longer after the onset of symptoms . Moreover , irrespective of the method , a combined IgG / IgM test seems to be a better choice in terms of sensitivity than measuring either antibody type alone . All methods\n",

The point - of - care format uses LoopX ( C ) , a small portative device ensuring optimal LAMP reaction and automated reading with 95 . 2 % and 95 . 5 % sensitivity and specificity respectively . This system might also be useful for testing other sample types such as saliva . RT - LAMP ( Reverse - Transcription and Loop - mediated isothermal AMPlification ) might advantageously increase testing efficiency as it allows all - in - one rapid test including RNA reverse transcription and DNA amplification without temperature cycles requirement . LAMP does not even require complex devices and laboratory infrastructures , RT - LAMP can use low - cost and mobile equipment already available in most molecular diagnostic laboratories and utilises the inhibitors tolerant Bst polymerase . These traits make LAMP useful in field detection assays . The use of LAMP in detection system has been explored for numerous micro - organisms and epidemic pathogen ( Zika - virus , Ebolavirus , Malaria ) several of which validated by WHO , an FAO [ 2 , 9 ] . SARS - CoV2 RT - LAMP tests were previously developed but to our knowledge , none of them propose a direct - from - swab , on field and all - in - one analytical solution such as ours . The innovationWe developed a specific RT - LAMP in dual format for the detection of SARS - CoV - 2 . The first one , named LoopXlab COVID - 19 operates without extraction in conventional thermalcyclers ( using 96 wells plates or 8 wells strips ) . The second one , named LoopXplore COVID - 19 , is designed for Point of Care ( without extraction ) and runs in the LoopX device ( in 1 . 5 ml µtube ) . The objective of the study was to evaluate the performance of our two detection methods\n",

Here , we analyze some of those implications and discuss ways of ameliorating the privacy concerns without decreasing usefulness to public health . We hope in writing this document to ensure that privacy is a central feature of conversations surrounding mobile contact tracing apps and to encourage community efforts to develop alternative effective solutions with stronger privacy protection for the users . Importantly , though we discuss potential modifications , this document is not meant as a formal research paper , but instead is a response to some of the privacy characteristics of direct contact tracing apps like TraceTogether and an early - stage Request for Comments to the community . Date written : 2020 - 03 - 24 Minor correction : 2020 - 03 - 30 IntroductionThe COVID - 19 pandemic has spread like wildfire across the globe . Very few countries have managed to keep it well - controlled , but one of the key tools that several such countries use is contact tracing . More specifically , whenever an individual is diagnosed with the coronavirus , every person who had possibly been near that infected individual during the period in which they were contagious is contacted and told to self - quarantine for two weeks . In the early days of the virus , when * Authors listed alphabetically . there were only a few cases , contact tracing could be done manually . With hundreds to thousands of cases surfacing in some cities , contact tracing has become much more difficult . IntroductionCountries have been employing a variety of means to enable contact tracing . In Israel , legislation was passed to allow the government to track the mobile - phone data of people with suspected infection . In South Korea , the government has maintained a public database of known patients , including information about their age , gender , occupation , and travel routes . In Taiwan , medical institutions were given access to patients travel histories , and authorities track</td>\n",

However , there are important privacy implications of the existence of such tracking apps . Here , we analyze some of those implications and discuss ways of ameliorating the privacy concerns without decreasing usefulness to public health . We hope in writing this document to ensure that privacy is a central feature of conversations surrounding mobile contact tracing apps and to encourage community efforts to develop alternative effective solutions with stronger privacy protection for the users . Importantly , though we discuss potential modifications , this document is not meant as a formal research paper , but instead is a response to some of the privacy characteristics of direct contact tracing apps like TraceTogether and an early - stage Request for Comments to the community . Date written : 2020 - 03 - 24 Minor correction : 2020 - 03 - 30 IntroductionThe COVID - 19 pandemic has spread like wildfire across the globe . Very few countries have managed to keep it well - controlled , but one of the key tools that several such countries use is contact tracing . More specifically , whenever an individual is diagnosed with the coronavirus , every person who had possibly been near that infected individual during the period in which they were contagious is contacted and told to self - quarantine for two weeks . In the early days of the virus , when * Authors listed alphabetically . there were only a few cases , contact tracing could be done manually . With hundreds to thousands of cases surfacing in some cities , contact tracing has become much more difficult . IntroductionCountries have been employing a variety of means to enable contact tracing . In Israel , legislation was passed to allow the government to track the mobile - phone data of people with suspected infection . In South Korea , the government has maintained a public database of known patients , including information about their age , gender , occupation , and travel routes . In Taiwan , medical institutions were given access to patients travel histories , and authorities track\n",

Likewise , if the centralized laboratory is \" off - site \" from 1 or more hospitals , it is necessary to have agreement on what testing capabilities will remain at the individual hospitals ; distance from hospitals to the new central laboratory and frequency and dependability of courier service will be key factors in determining what testing remains at individual hospitals in the system .

RNA aptamers are presented . Quantitative and qualitative determination of nucle ic acids is an important problem of modern biology and medicine . This research area has been developing very rapidly since the early 1990s , and it is very likely that the number of studies on this topic will continue to grow in the next decades . Detection of DNA / RNA of pathogenic bacteria and viruses could be essential for choosing an appropriate treatment strategy . Recent studies have dis covered the correlation between the risk of developing certain diseases in humans and single nucleotide poly morphisms or short insertions / deletions . It was also found that human microRNA genes are often located in the vicinity of genome regions and sites associated with cancer .

Here , we analyze some of those implications and discuss ways of ameliorating the privacy concerns without decreasing usefulness to public health . We hope in writing this document to ensure that privacy is a central feature of conversations surrounding mobile contact tracing apps and to encourage community efforts to develop alternative effective solutions with stronger privacy protection for the users . Importantly , though we discuss potential modifications , this document is not meant as a formal research paper , but instead is a response to some of the privacy characteristics of direct contact tracing apps like TraceTogether and an early - stage Request for Comments to the community .

Very few countries have managed to keep it well - controlled , but one of the key tools that several such countries use is contact tracing . More specifically , whenever an individual is diagnosed with the coronavirus , every person who had possibly been near that infected individual during the period in which they were contagious is contacted and told to self - quarantine for two weeks .

This is the first reported case of a sub - occipital craniectomy with brain biopsy in a COVID - 19 patient showing leptomeningeal venous intimal inflammation . CLINICAL DESCRIPTION : The patient is a 48 - year - old SARS - COV - 2 positive male with multiple comorbidities , who presented with fevers and respiratory symptoms , and imaging consistent with multifocal pneumonia . On day 5 of admission , the patient had sudden change in mental status , increased C - Reactive Protein , ferritin and elevated Interleukin - 6 levels . Head CT showed cerebral infarction from vertebral artery occlusion . Given subsequent rapid neurologic decline from cerebellar swelling and mass effect on his brainstem emergent neurosurgical intervention was performed . Brain biopsy found a vein with small organizing thrombus adjacent to focally proliferative intima with focal intimal neutrophils . CONCLUSION : A young man with COVID - 19 and suspected immune dysregulation , complicated by a large cerebrovascular ischemic stroke secondary to vertebral artery thrombosis requiring emergent neurosurgical intervention for decompression with improved neuro</td>\n",

BACKGROUND : This report and literature review describes a case of a COVID - 19 patient who suffered a cerebellar stroke requiring neurosurgical decompression . This is the first reported case of a sub - occipital craniectomy with brain biopsy in a COVID - 19 patient showing leptomeningeal venous intimal inflammation . CLINICAL DESCRIPTION : The patient is a 48 - year - old SARS - COV - 2 positive male with multiple comorbidities , who presented with fevers and respiratory symptoms , and imaging consistent with multifocal pneumonia . On day 5 of admission , the patient had sudden change in mental status , increased C - Reactive Protein , ferritin and elevated Interleukin - 6 levels . Head CT showed cerebral infarction from vertebral artery occlusion . Given subsequent rapid neurologic decline from cerebellar swelling and mass effect on his brainstem emergent neurosurgical intervention was performed . Brain biopsy found a vein with small organizing thrombus adjacent to focally proliferative intima with focal intimal neutrophils . CONCLUSION : A young man with COVID - 19 and suspected immune dysregulation , complicated by a large cerebrovascular ischemic stroke secondary to vertebral artery thrombosis requiring emergent neurosurgical intervention for decompression with improved neuro\n",

Serum neutralizing antibody more easily fulfills the latter requisite , but current live virus methods for neutralization prevent large - scale application . It is conceivable that the exposure of previously infected individuals can allow for the definition of protective thresholds of neutralizing antibody .

At this time , the best correlates with protection from natural coronavirus infections are systemic neutralizing antibody and mucosal IgA . Serum neutralizing antibody more easily fulfills the latter requisite , but current live virus methods for neutralization prevent large - scale application . It is conceivable that the exposure of previously infected individuals can allow for the definition of protective thresholds of neutralizing antibody . Thereafter , many other antibody assays will be able to screen for surrogate protection after correlations with protective neutralizing antibody are made . Specificity of common antibody tests would benefit from confirmatory blocking systems or confirmatory immu\n",

Instead of giving a list of do ' s and don ' t s , this tutorial tries to build a better understanding behind these do ' s and don ' t s and presents both the most relevant performance evaluation criteria as well as how to compute them . Along the way , we will indicate common mistakes and provide references discussing various topics more in - depth . IntroductionData - driven approaches for healthcare decision support , such as those driven by Machine Learning ( ML ) , have seen a surge in interest over recent years , partly driven by the promising results that a ' reborn ' AI research branch has generated . As the name says , these approaches rely on the availability of data to extract\n",

In practice, these strategies lead to a relatively small fraction of positive tests among those tested and thus to inefficient use of the precious testing resources.introductionhere, we present a model that provides statistically significant estimates of the probability of an individual to test positive for sars-cov-2 infection in a pcr test, based on a national symptom survey that we distributed in israel.Our approach can thus be used globally to make more efficient use of available testing capacities, by significantly increasing the fraction of positive tests obtained, and by rapidly identifying individuals that should be isolated until definitive test results are obtained.introduction.\n",

This is particularly challenging, particularly given the scale of validation study required for a suitable candidate lfia as to demonstrate a high specificity if the true underlying value was 98%, 1000 negative controls would be required to estimate the specificity of an assay to +/-1% with approximately 90% power.appraisal of test performanceas part of the evaluation of test performance the influence of population prevalence also needs to be considered, acknowledging that at present this is rapidly changing (brenner and gefeller 1997) .appraisal of test performancethis can be considered as the proportion of all positive tests that are wrong, as well as the number of incorrect positive tests per 1000 people tested.For example a point of care test with 70% sensitivity and 98% specificity, the proportion of positive tests that are wrong is 35% at 5% population seroprevalence (19 false-positives/1000 tested), 13% at 20% seroprevalence (16 falsepositives/1000) and 3% at 50% seroprevalence (10 false-positives/1000).appraisal of test performanceaccording to available data, seropositivity prevalence is still low.In contrast, negative tests need to be interpreted with caution, and a single negative sars-cov-2 test in a patient with strongly suggestive symptoms should not be relied upon to exclude covid19.\n",

However, with no 'gold standard' for antibody testing and an incomplete knowledge of the immunology of covid-19, evaluating tests with the assumption that antibodies 'should' be there, and comparatively to rt-pcr, is problematic.Accordingly, we developed a highly specific semi-quantitative 4 elisa for the detection of anti-spike (s), -s receptor binding domain (rbd) and -n antibodies, and used this to cross-evaluate ten commercial antibody tests (seven lateral flow immunoassays (lfias), one chemiluminescent assay and two elisas) on a collection of 110 serum samples from confirmed rna positive patients, and 50 pre-pandemic samples from march 2019.Weaker antibody responses yielded mixed results from the lfias, with a clear pattern of increasing detection of antibodies seen across all tests with increasing time pos.Association of antibody detection with days pos and severity of diseasesample-by-sample analyses of multiple serological assays showed a trend for increasing detection of antibodies with increasing days pos (up to 30).While this could highlight a characteristic of covid-19 where a subset of patients do not produce a detectable antibody response, we have evidence that in three cases (the two day 10 samples and sixth day 14) where later samples were available (47, 77 and 51 days pos, respectively; the only next available samples) both igm and igg antibodies were detected in several lfias.\n",

The principal difference is that antibody tests require identification of distinct proteins that form the viral coat, with elucidation of which proteins are most divergent from previous coronavirus proteins; then identification of specific antibodies to these proteins that are part of the acquired immune response to viral exposure, and finally testing to ensure that there is limited crossreactivity with antibodies developed to other historical coronaviruses.building an indirect test for sars-cov-2: serological testingwith the previous two coronaviruses a variety of assays encompassing different methodologies were developed including elisa, chemiluminescence, western blot, protein microarray, and immunofluorescence platforms.It is these platforms which are once again being examined for detection of antibodies to sars-cov-2.appraisal of test performanceappropriate thresholds for sensitivity and specificity of an antibody test depend on its purpose and must be considered prior to implementation.In lateral flow assays, a membrane strip is coated with two lines: gold nanoparticle-antibody conjugates are in one line and bind antibodies in the other.\n",

The antibody-dependent enhancement related to viral infection is a paradoxical process characterized by the presence of virus specific antibodies that augment viral entry within host cells and replication of the pathogen, leading to an exacerbation of the disease  .The passive immunization by early administration of convalescent plasma or hyper-immune immunoglobulin from patients that contains significant antibody titers might be efficient in reducing the viral load and disease mortality, but there are some factors that need to be elucidated before treatment initiation, such as the availability of sufficient donors, clinical condition, viral kinetics, and host interactions of sars-cov-2 [12, 35] .immunotherapyconsidering the imperative need to find an effective treatment against sars-cov-2 infection (which is lacking at present), administration of immune \"convalescent\" sera containing neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov-2 was viewed as a viable approach, with rapid results by conferring immediate immunity to highly susceptible patients [147, 148] .Even though there are several reported mas targeting the rbd region of s protein, a receptor-binding domain located in the s1 subunit that mediates the virus attachment to the host cells, the large-scale production of monoclonal antibodies is labor-intensive, expensive, and time-consuming, which outweighs their clinical application especially during emerging situations like the novel sars-cov-2 outbreak [12, 35] .immunotherapyan example of monoclonal antibody included in the interim guidelines for covid-19 treatment in critically ill patients is tocilizumab.\n",

Results showed that both stains exhibited significant right shift of id8 population (fig.1 , b and c, red peaks), validated the id8's ability to bind ace2, indicating the spike is in trimeric membrane status and mimics the function of covid-19 spike 16 .biopanning naïve phage antibody library yielded multiple rbd hitsaiming to obtain antibodies that directly target to rbd of covid-19 spike so that they have limited binding sites, and great chance of interference to the interaction between spike and ace2, we used rbd fusion (rbd-mfc) instead of full-length or subunit of covid-19 spike protein as bait in the biopanning from ehl library in a solid phase approach 17 .Among the lambda scfv hits, most of them (30/37) have almost same complementarity-determining region (cdr) compositions in both vh and vλ, with sporadic differences in the framework region (fr), implying fast enrichment of antibody recognizing certain epitope.membrane spike bound antibodies are specific for covid-19phage antibody hits tend to be false positive by elisa detection, due to the stickiness of phage proteins 18 and epitope/conformation differences between purified/truncated protein and membrane/full-length parental molecule 19 or lose the reactivity because the once exposed epitopes in protein fragment become inaccessible in native protein.To verify the authenticity of the phage antibody binders and check their ability to recognize cell membrane trimeric covid-19 spike, we first generated soluble antibodies to facilitate further characterization of their properties.Upon protein-a purification and aggregates removal to make sure monomer achieved over 95%, the antibodies were tested by facs on above-generated id8 cells to screen positive membrane covid-19 spike binders, which are the potential neutralizing antibody candidates.membrane spike bound antibodies are specific for covid-198 out of the 22 expressed scfv-hufc antibodies demonstrated significant id8 cell-binding capabilities with varied shifts by facs (fig.3) .For the convenience of description, we categorized the epitope as group ⅰ (1b1 antibody), group ⅱ (5c2 antibody) and group ⅲ (antibody 1b11, 1a5, 1a12, 1g6, 1h2 and 1c10).spike+ cells are bound simultaneously by rbd-antibodies and ace2in silicon examined by blitz done above on the obtained rbd-antibodies implied their potential varied interferences to the ace2 interaction with covid-19 spike.\n",
