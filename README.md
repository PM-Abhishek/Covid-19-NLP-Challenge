CORD-19 aims to connect the machine learning community with biomedical domain experts and policy makers in the race to identify effective treatments and management policies for Covid-19. The goal is to harness these diverse and complementary pools of expertise to discover relevant information more quickly from the literature. Users of the dataset have leveraged a variety of AI based techniques in information retrieval and natural language processing to extract useful information
To make this happen, The Community of Kaggle is all in with the CORD 19 Dataset which contains resources of over 200,000 scholarly articles, including over 100,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related corona viruses. 
            There is a growing urgency to apply recent advances in natural language processing and other AI techniques to generate new insights in support of the ongoing fight against this infectious disease. Text and data mining tools that can help the medical community develop answers to high priority scientific questions are the Need of the Hour. Most of the tasks under this dataset have questions that could be answered using Text Mining tools from an enormous amount of resource papers available
